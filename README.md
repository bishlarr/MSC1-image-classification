# MSC5-Deep-Learning-images-classification

The project MSC5-Deep-Learning-images-classification is a data scientist MSc student project.

An animal association wants to automate the identification of its residents from their photos. 
To do so, we use Deep Learning models, which are very efficient for classifying images.

The input files are not present into the Git. It consists into 16.090 dog images belonging to 120 different breeds.
These images come from the Stanford Dogs Dataset: http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs

Main librairies:

  - Python scientific libraries
  - Tensorflow
  - Keras
  - Seaborn
  - Sklearn

Main models:

  - VGG16
  - pretrained VGG16 (weights="imagenet")
